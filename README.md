# [Pudding](https://github.com/vaibhav-y/pudding)

Inspired by Srijan Choudhary's [puAlert.php](https://github.com/srijan/puAlert), thank you for this wonderful idea!

### Description
Pudding is a Ruby script written using mechanize to login to your PU account for you and download files related to unread notifications. But wait, there's more. This comes as a binary `pudding.exe` for all the others who didn't install ruby yet! No hassle logging in, you just need to fill up `pudding_client_config.xml` generated by pudding.exe once and you are set to go! Later planned features include polling, password hashes (Thanks Shriniwas), and an obviously required speedup


### Usage

[Download the release](https://github.com/vaibhav-y/pudding/releases/tag/v0.1-r13)

##### Console method (You see what's happeing)
1. Open your windows command prompt ([Relevant links incase you're lost](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/a/command-prompt-windows-7.htm))
2. Navigate to the directory where `pudding.exe` is located
3. In the command prompt type `pudding.exe` and hit `enter`, something like the image below should happen:

4. Open `pudding_client_config.xml`, located in the same directory with notepad to see something like:

	```xml
	
	<o c="Configuration::AppConfig::ClientConf">
	  <s a="@username"></s>
	  <s a="@password"></s>
	</o>
	```

5. Fill your placement unit username in ```xml 	<s a="@username"></s>``` as ```xml <s a="@username">f2010XYZ</s>```
6. Fill your placement unit password in ```xml <s a="@password"></s>``` as ```xml <s a="@password">YOUR_PASSWORD_GOES_EXACTLY_HERE</s>``` 
7. You should be doing this, and only this (for now atleat, suggestions are welcome):

8. Do not change `pudding_server_config.xml`, that file is very important in connecting to the PU server!
9. Yes, you must fill the username and password, this is as lazy as you can get! :D


##### Click method (You don't see what's happening)

1. Navigate to the directory where `pudding.exe` is located
2. Double click `pudding.exe` and wait till it exits
3. It should have created `pudding_client_config.xml` and `pudding_server_config.xml` in the very same directory
4. Edit `pudding_client_config.xml` the same way as previously described
5. Same gotchas apply here too


### TODO

* Write Rspec Tests
* Polling functionality
* One time console prompt to enter password (for setting the config)
* Optional UI
* Write a detailed guide to filling in `pudding_client_config.xml`
